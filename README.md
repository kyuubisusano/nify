A simple project to Create Nft and sell it

I created this project to learn many concepts, main focus of the project was more in the front end side, to make whole website responsive ,still there is a lot of work to do but unfortunately( because of other project and scaling issues) development of this project is on the halt ,I may comeback to complete this project if I feel like it.

### Todo:
1. create better authentication method 
2. better loading logic for selling and buying
3. update the smart contract for sale date fucntionality
4. add logic for reselling asset with supply
5. better form validation 

### Installation

1. **npm i** to install dependencies

2. **npm run dev** to run project


### Important!

To run this project you have to deploy your contract in a testnet ,I have used Ropsten Testnet
Ropsten TestNet which is going to get depreciated in Q4 2022.
